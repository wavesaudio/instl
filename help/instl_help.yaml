command:
    check-checksum:
        short: Check synced files against their expected sha1 checksum (utility command)
        long: |
            Usage: instl check-checksum --in path-to-input-file [--start-progress start-progress-number] [--total-progress total-progress-number]
            check-checksum will calculate the sha1 checksum of each file listed in path-to-input-file and compare this checksum against the expected checksum listed in path-to-input-file.
            path-to-input-file should be a path to a file in info_map.txt format containing a list of the files to check. All file paths listed in path-to-input-file are relative to the current directory.
            A list of non matching or missing files is printed at the end.
            Non zero exit code is returned if any file in path-to-input-file is missing or has non matching checksum.
            check-checksum command is used in the batch created by the sync or synccopy commands and path-to-input-file would be bookkeeping/to_sync_info_map.txt.
            If --start-progress and --total-progress options are given, check-checksum will output progress messages starting with the number given in --start-progress with a total given in total-progress. Progress message for action N would be:
            Progress start-progress-number+N of total-progress;

    checksum:
        short: calculate sha1 checksum for a file or files in a folder (utility command)
        long: |
            Usage: instl checksum --in path_to_file_or_folder_to_checksum
            checksum command just calculates the file(s)'s checksum, it does not check against any given checksum as or check-checksum command does.
            checksum is a utility command, it is not needed for creating or using instl-based installer.

    copy:
        short: Install files to their destination (client command)
        long: |
            Usage: instl copy --in instl-config-yaml-file --out copy.sh [--run]
            instl's copy command will create a batch file containing instructions to copy files to their designated locations on disk. Said files were previously downloaded using the sync command. Definition of what to copy to which destination is taken from the instl-config-yaml-file.
            Keep in mind that copy command does not actually copy anything, unless the --run flag is given. You will need to run the produced batch file in order to actually install the files.

    create-folders:
        short: Create folders in preparation for sync (utility command)
        long: |
            Usage: instl create-folders --in path-to-input-file [--start-progress start-progress-number] [--total-progress total-progress-number]
            For each item marked as folder in path-to-input-file create-folders will create the folder relative to the current directory.
            path-to-input-file should be a path to a file in info_map.txt format containing a list of the folders to check.
            create-folders command is used in the batch created by the sync or synccopy commands and path-to-input-file would be bookkeeping/to_sync_info_map.txt.
            If --start-progress and --total-progress options are given, check-checksum will output progress messages starting with the number given in --start-progress with a total given in total-progress. Progress message for action N would be:
            Progress start-progress-number+N of total-progress;

    create-infomap:
        short: Creates infomap file from local svn repository (admin command)
        long: |
            Usage: instl create-infomap --config-file config_file --out create-infomap.sh [--run]
            "Looks for svn repository in variable $(WORKING_SVN_CHECKOUT_FOLDER) and creates a full info_map.txt file on level above this folder.
            The info_map.txt file has for each dir or file in the repository a line in the format:
            file-path, f|d[x], repo-rev, sha1 cehcsum, file size
            for example:
                Common/Data/IR1Impulses/Basic/Hall1_mcg.wir, f, 27, 85f7fd7757aa458998886ea07e083424bfdb050c, 680044

    create-links:
        short: Maintains a folder of revision specific folders ready to be uploaded by the up2s3 command (admin command)
        long: |
            Usage: instl create-links --config-file config_file --out create-links.sh [--all-revisions] [--run]
            For each revision of the svn repository, starting with the base revision, create-links will checkout the revision from svn to a Base folder, and copy the files to a folder named after the revision. Copying is done using hard links and hence the name of the command. In addition create-links will create info_map files describing the contents of the specific revision. A revision folder created successfully will contain a stamp file, that will cause the folder to be skipped the next time create-links is called.
            All information about the svn repository url, the location of the top level links folder, the base revision etc, is taken from the config file.
            relevant variables: REPO_NAME, SVN_REPO_URL, ROOT_LINKS_FOLDER_REPO, BASE_REPO_REV
            if --all-revisions option is given create-links will work on all revisions in the svn reporsitory starting with BASE_REPO_REV. Otherwise only revisions upto REPO_REV will be considered.
            Keep in mind that create-links command does not actually do anything, unless the --run flag is given. You will need to run the produced batch file in order to actually create the links.

    create-repo-rev-file:
        short: creates a file containing basic information about a specific revision (admin command)
        long: |
            The created file can be uploaded to s3 once the specific revision is ready for distribution, using up-repo-rev command.
            The variables in the created file are specified in REPO_REV_FILE_VARS variable.
            This command is intended to be called by the create-links command.

    depend:
        short: Create a full dependencies list from index.yaml (admin command)
        long: |
            Usage instl depend --in index-file --out depend-file
            Reads the given index-file and for each IID prints to depend-file all the IID it depends on and all IID needed by it.
            To print to standard out specify --out stdout

    fail:
        short: Fail on purpose and return an exit code (utility command)
        long: |
            Usage: instl fail [--exit-code a_number]
            The fail command is used to simulate a situation where instl fail and returns an exit code (ERRORLEVEL on windows).
            If --exit-code is given that number is use as exit code, otherwise default exit code is 1.

    fix-perm:
        short: Fix unix style permissions (admin command)
        long: |
            Usage: instl fix-perm --config-file path_to_config_file --out path-to-output-file [--limit sub-folder, [sub-folder]] [--run]
            Fixes unix style permisions in the stage folder (variable STAGING_FOLDER) (or in subset thereof if --limit option is suplied). First, files that match the regex in variable EXEC_PROP_REGEX are made executbles (chmod a+x), all other files are made non-executbale (chmod a-x). Second, all file and folders are made read/write and the executable bit (if any) is extended for all files and folders, by running the command 'chmod a+rw,+X'. This command should be used before the wtar command so that files and folders being wtarred will have the correct permisions.
            fix-perm will output a list of files who's executable bit is about to change. Be sure to go over the list and check that the proposed changes are acceptable before running the batch file.
            Keep in mind that fix-perm command does not actually do anything, unless the --run flag is given. You will need to run the produced batch file in order to actually fix the permissions.

    fix-props:
        short: Fix certain properties in svn repository (admin command)
        long: |
            Usage: instl fix-props --out path-to-output-file --config-file path-to-config-file [--run]
            Removes or adds svn:executable property where appropriate and removes all other properties. Files are assumed to be executables if their path matchs the regexs specified in variable EXEC_PROP_REGEX. The path to SVN repository is taken from the SVN_CHECKOUT_FOLDER variable.
            Keep in mind that fix-props command does not actually do anything, unless the --run flag is given. You will need to run the produced batch file in order to actually fix the properties. Also, running the batch file does not commit the properties changes, this should be manually done, after proper inspection, with an SVM client software.

    fix-symlinks:
        short: Replace symlinks with .symlink files (admin command)
        long: |
            Usage:instl fix-symlinks  --config-file path_to_config_file --out path-to-output-file [--run]
            Since s3 cannot deal with symlinks, symlinks should not be committed to svn. Instead the fix-symlinks command will replace each symlinks with file with the same name and the extension .symlink. The .symlink file will contain the relative path of the symlink.
            The folder where symlinks will be fixed is specifies in STAGING_FOLDER variable in path_to_config_file.
            Keep in mind that fix-symlinks command does not actually do anything, unless the --run flag is given. You will need to run the produced batch file in order to actually fix the symlinks.

    help:
        short: display help text about command, variable or command line option

            instl's remove command will create a batch file containing instructions to remove files from their designated locations on disk. Said files were previously copied using the copy command. Definition of what items to remove from which destination is taken from the instl-config-yaml-file. Default remove action for installed item is to erase the files from disk, but other instructions can be given in the instl-config-yaml-file. All items and their dependecies are removed without considering if other items might depend on the removed items.
            Keep in mind that remove command does not actually copy anything, unless the --run flag is given. You will need to run the produced batch file in order to actually remove the files.

    report-versions:
        short: Report all IIDs with their guids, installed version and latest version form index (client command)

    stage2svn:
        short: Update svn from a staging folder (admin command)
        long: |
           Usage: instl stage2svn --config-file  path-to-config-file --out stage2svn.sh [--run]
           Making changes to the svn repository cannot be done on the svn checkout folder directly, mainly because svn finds it difficult to handle deleted files.
           When the staging folder (created by the svn2stage command) is ready, stage2svn can be called to create the svn command to add/delete files. Existing files that were changed will be discovered by svn itself. Before calling stage2svn it is advisable to call fix-symlinks, stage2svn will not accept new symlinks.
           Keep in mind that stage2svn command does not actually do anything, unless the --run flag is given. You will need to run the produced batch file in order to actually run the svn commands and then manually commit the changes to svn.

Definition of what to sync from what url and what to copy to which destination is taken from the instl-config-yaml-file
            Keep in mind that synccopy command does not actually download or copy anything, unless the --run flag is given. You will need to run the produced batch file in order to actually download and install the files.

    trans:
        short: Translates between the various format of svn info files (admin command)
        long:  |
            Usage: instl trans --in svn_info_file [--props svn_props_file] [--filter-in version_to_filter_in]
            instl's trans command can translate between the format created by svn info command and the native instl info format. Additional input that can be given is the output of the svn proplist command. trans also has limited filtering options.
            trans command is used in the output of create-links command.

    translate_url:
        short: Translates to canonical form according to the current connection (utility command)
        long:  |
            Usage: instl translate_url --in url_to_translate [--credentials s3:ACCESS_KEY:SECRET_KEY:BUCKET]
            instl's translate_url translate a url so it can be passed to a browser or download utility such as curl.
            If no --credentials is given, the translation will simply replace characters to ascii and spaces to %20.
            If --credentials is given instl will connect and build a url suitable for use. Currently only Amazon s3 connection is supported.

    test-import:
        short: Test that python imports inside instl are successful (utility command)
        long:   |
            Usage: instl test-import
            Helps making sure instl will function OK by trying out various import statements that instl uses. Especially useful after compiling instl in making sure the compiled binrary can find all the necessary imports.
            If all imports are OK, no message is written to stdout (except command timing statistics) and exit code is 0. In case of error a list of missing modules is printed and non-zero exit code is returned.

    uninstall:
        short: Remove installed files considering dependencies (client command)
        long: |
            Usage: instl uninstall --in instl-config-yaml-file --out uninstall.sh [--run]
            instl's uninstall command will create a batch file containing instructions to remove files from their designated locations on disk. Said files were previously copied using the copy command. Definition of what items to remove from which destination is taken from the instl-config-yaml-file. Default uninstall action for installed item is to erase the files from disk, but other instructions can be given in the instl-config-yaml-file. Items and their dependecies are removed only if they are not needed by other items that remain installed.
            Keep in mind that uninstall command does not actually copy anything, unless the --run flag is given. You will need to run the produced batch file in order to actually uninstall the files.

    unwtar:
        short: Combines split wtar files and uncompresses wtar files (utility command)
        long: |
            Usage: instl unwtar [--in file-or-folder] [--out] [--no-artifacts]
            Files who's extension is in the format '*.wtar.aa' are being read as one without being combined first.
            Files who's extension is in the format '*.wtar' are untared to their directory.
            If --no-artifacts option is given in all .wtar.??, .wtar and .done files are removed.
            If --in option is given, unwtar acts on the given file or folder. Otherwise it will work on the currect direcotry. Working on direcotries is recursive.
            If --out option is given, unwtar extracts into this folder. Otherwise it will extract into the current direcotry.
            unwtar command is used in the batch file created by the sync or synccopy commands.

    up-repo-rev:
        short: Upload a file containing basic information about uploaded repository (admin command)
        long: |
            Usage: instl up-repo-rev --config-file config_file
            up-repo-rev will create a repo_rev file according to the information in the config file, and upload said repo_rev file to s3 bucket to a top level folder called 'admin'. The contents of the repo_rev file are a list of variables defined in the "REPO_REV_FILE_VARS" variable of the config file. Typically these variables would be: REPO_REV, REPO_TYPE, SYNC_BASE_URL.
            relevant variables:
                S3_BUCKET_NAME
                REPO_REV_FILE_NAME, REPO_REV_FILE_VARS, REPO_TYPE, REPO_REV, REPO_NAME

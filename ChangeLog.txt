    user visible changes, client:
    * Main feature: support for Windows XP.
    * Fixed: COPY_TOOL set to xcopy was ignored (WinXP).
    * Solved weird problems with xcopy. The /EXCLUDE option of xcopy cannot except a file with space it's path,
        nor will it except a quoted path. So the excludes file is copied to each and every target folder
        during the copy stage.
    * Fixed: when compiled raised exceptions would not cause exit code > 0 (Windows).
    * Fixed: Redundant messages when checksum fails.
    * Shorter max time for curl since now no file is > 5MB.
    * Fixed a bug in function need_to_download_file where True was always returned. This caused already downloaded files
        to be redownloaded if some situations.
    * PARALLEL_SYNC: 32 - new default

    user visible changes, admin:
    * More concise messages for create-links and up2s3

    * New copy tools methods begin_copy_folder, end_copy_folder  to overcome xcopy limitations.
    * Changes to variable names:
         LOCAL_SYNC_DIR now always refers to the to top level sync dirs - above repo sync dir.
         LOCAL_REPO_SYNC_DIR - new - defaults to $(LOCAL_SYNC_DIR)/$(REPO_NAME), e.g. /Users/shai/Library/Caches/Waves Audio/instl/instl.waves.com/V9_test
         SOURCE_PREFIX - new - defaults to $(TARGET_OS)
         LOCAL_BOOKKEEPING_PATH - renamed LOCAL_REPO_BOOKKEEPING_DIR
         REPO_REV_LOCAL_BOOKKEEPING_PATH - renamed LOCAL_REPO_REV_BOOKKEEPING_DIR
         LOCAL_REPO_SOURCES_DIR - removed - use $(LOCAL_REPO_SYNC_DIR)/$(SOURCE_PREFIX) instead
         SYNC_TRAGET_OS_URL - removed - replaced by $(SYNC_BASE_URL)/$(TARGET_OS)
    * Due to variable changed method InstlClient.init_copy_vars is empty now.
    * functions main_url_item now return parseResult.netloc OR parseResult.path not both

    user visible changes, client:

    user visible changes, client:
    * Fixed many sync bugs especialy on Windows.
    * New automatic installation items:
        __ALL_ITEMS_IID__:  all the iids from the index
        __ALL_GUIDS_IID__: all the iids from the index that have guids.

    * Time reporting on exit with error on Mac.

    * More precise, and less verbose, progress messages. No fake progress message when there's nothing to be done.
    * More precise decision when to untar existing wtar files.
    * New Yaml variable: LAST_PROGRESS, set the number of progress items to start with, so two batch files can have
        consecutive progress reports. Defaults to 0.
    * After creating a batch file, the full path to file is printed and the number of progress items.
        This number can be passed to the next invocation of instl as LAST_PROGRESS variable.
    * curl will print "Progress ... of ...;" at the beginning of each report line, to allow the invoker of
        the batch file to track progress even in the absent of absolute numbers.
    * New include style:
        url: $(INDEX_URL)
        checksum: $(INDEX_CHECKSUM)
        sig: $(INDEX_SIG)
        This will cache the file and use the local copy if it matches signature and checksum.
    * Sync command adds __NUM_FILES_TO_DOWNLOAD__ variable with the number of files to download.
    * New yaml doc type !define_const - will create const variables and will not except __include__'s.
    * curl config files and file with list of curl commands are written to a folder named "curl".
        This will avoid clutter in the sync folder and make deleting easier.
    * No more DL_INSTRUCTIONS_TYPE, always use config file. To do non parallel download set PARALLEL_SYNC: 1.
    * Variables ending with _PATH or _DIR will have their value go through os.path.normpath - for proper paths on Windows.
    * New variable: __READ_YAML_FILES__ will list all yaml files that were read.

    * Untaring writes a stamp file when finished corectly. Will prevent redundant re-untar.
    * New BatchAccumulator function __len__, returns the total assignments and instrauction lines.
    * parallel_run.py: plain exit() did not work in compiled code, replaced with sys.exit().
    * got rid of redundant __ALLOWED_COMMANDS__ variable and checking.
    * instlInstanceBase.get_default_sync_dir overhaul  - will use $() variables and will need resolving.
    * Fixed ConfigVar.__str__ so values appear before description.
    * Removed redundant imports from helpHelper.py.
    * Refactored InstlClient to work with standard do_ ... functions for commands.
    * InstlClient.installState is now a member.
    * InstlClient.init_copy_vars moved from instlInstanceBase.
    * Many default variables read from files instead of being hard coded.

        incorporated into fix_symlinks.
    * Read/Write of info files can handle checksum field for files. All formats info/text/yaml
    * Fixed: --run option was required for trans command, although run is not relevant for this command.
    * Function renames: create_download_file_to_file_command -> download_url_to_file
                        create_download_from_config_file -> download_from_config_file

    * added fix_props command to add/remove inappropriate properties in the svn repository.

        So the getter function is called instead.
    * platformSpecificHelper rmdir method accepts new parameter 'recursive'
        when True enables the deletion of non-empty directories.
    * SVNTopItem new method min_max_rev, returns the minimal and maximal last_rev
        of it's sub-items.
    * CONFIG_FILE renamed __CONFIG_FILE__ because it's an internal variable.
    * __CONFIG_FILE__ is resolved and value assigned to __CONFIG_FILE_PATH__.
    * Config file is read once for all commands.
    * added props member to SVNItem to hold properties that are not executable or special (symlink)
    * Rearranged instlAdmin.py to deduce the name of the method to run from the command name
        ("fix_symlinks" -> do_fix_symlinks()))
    * fixed typos and redundant lines in progress report.     user visible changes:

2/1/2014 0.6.4  Shai Shasag <shai@waves.com>
    user visible changes:
    * instl version command works.
    * produced files get remark with the version of instl that created them.
    * sync one_by_one produces meaningfull progress report.
    * Windows: can download files with spaces in their name, such as "WaveShell-DAE 9.2.dpm".

    programmer visible changes:
    * Windows: urls need to escape spaces as %20, but windows batch files already
        escape '%' characters so use urllib.quote to escape spaces and then change
        %20 to %%20.

2/1/2014 0.6.3  Shai Shasag <shai@waves.com>
    * recompiled 0.6.3 for windows because the file instMisc.py was missing from previous
        compilation.

    user visible changes:
    * Printing exceptions with traceback and returning proper exit code in case of failure
    * Renamed GET_URL_CLIENT_PATH to DOWNLOAD_TOOL_PATH
    * Removed unecessary indentation in svn output files
    * Fixed get_install_instructions_prefix for Mac - #!/bin/sh returned first
    * No resolving of readlink files. Temporary until we fiind a coherent method of handling symlinks
    * produced batch files on windows return to the orignal starting dir

    programmer visible changes:
    * Raising exception if REPRO_TYPE is not defined for sync command
    * Raising exceptions in instl.main (handled and unhandled)
    * DOWNLOAD_TOOL_PATH used as variable in download tools
    * Added return_original_if_not_found to instlInstance.search_paths_helper.find_file_with_search_paths
    * import urllib in platformSpecificHelper_Win
    * Normalized paths for windows, so they always have \. Since some DOS commands cannot handle /

    user visible changes:
    * curl DL_INSTRUCTIONS_TYPE: either config_file or one_by_one
    * new instl commands:
        ** create_readlinks, creates .readlink files instead of symlink
        ** resolve_readlinks creates symlinks instead of .readlinks file - currentlu used in copy on Mac OS
    * trans command now reads BASE_REV from config file, has new option --config
    * up2s3 command implemented using aws and writes a batch file like all other commands
    * up2s3 command can be used on a range of versions
    * * fixed bad handling of \r\n in info_map files on Windows 

    programmer visible changes:
    * new function SVNItem.walk_items_depth_first, and tests for this function
    * platformSpecificHelper_XXX new functions: rmfile, rmdir, not implemented for windows yet
    * variable BASE_REPO_REV default set to 1 for all commands

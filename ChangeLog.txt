    * Solved weird problems with xcopy. The /EXCLUDE option of xcopy cannot except a file with space it's path,

        This number can be passed to the next invocation of instl as LAST_PROGRESS variable.

    * New yaml doc type !define_const - will create const variables and will not except __include__'s.

    * New BatchAccumulator function __len__, returns the total assignments and instrauction lines.
    * parallel_run.py: plain exit() did not work in compiled code, replaced with sys.exit().
    * got rid of redundant __ALLOWED_COMMANDS__ variable and checking.

        Example:

        incorporated into fix_symlinks.
    * Read/Write of info files can handle checksum field for files. All formats info/text/yaml
    * Fixed: --run option was required for trans command, although run is not relevant for this command.
    * Function renames: create_download_file_to_file_command -> download_url_to_file
                        create_download_from_config_file -> download_from_config_file

    user visible changes, client:
    * Windows: improved batch file creation: @echo off
    * create_variables_assignment now always writes all internal variables, even in debug mode.
    * Output files on Linux and Mac get "set -e" so the fail if any sub-commands fails.

    user visible changes, admin:
    * added fix_symlinks command to replace symlinks with .symlink files. Worls only on Mac.
    * changed behaviour of create_links and up2s3 to be responsible for the whole links folder

        --revision command line option is not available any more.
    * added fix_props command to add/remove inappropriate properties in the svn repository.
    * stamp file for createlinks and up2s3 will contain the base_repo_rev.
        So if repo_rev changes, new links will be created and uploaded.

    programmer visible changes:
    * Variable ROOT_VERSION_NAME changed to REPO_NAME
    * fixed: ConstConfigVar cannot refer to an inherited member that begin with __.

        when True enables the deletion of non-empty directories.
    * SVNTopItem new method min_max_rev, returns the minimal and maximal last_rev
        of it's sub-items.

        escape '%' characters so use urllib.quote to escape spaces and then change
        %20 to %%20.

2/1/2014 0.6.3  Shai Shasag <shai@waves.com>
